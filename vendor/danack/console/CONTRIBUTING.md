Pull-requests for bugs and features are gratefully accepted if they are accompanied by test cases.

Just to note, this project does not follow PSR-2 - when coding I switch between Java, PHP, Javascript, C and SQL. I try to use a style that is as consistent as possible across all of them rather than having to switch my thought processes between them. Also PSR-2 is just _ugly_.
