Installation
============

The only supported installation method is through Composer either from
`Packagist <https://packagist.org/packages/danack/console/>`_  or directly from `Github <https://github.com/danack/console>`_.

Just to note, I've decided to keep in sync with the version number of Symfony/Console rather than starting this fork with 1.0.0.
 
Theoretically this will allow switching back and forth between Symfony/console and Danack/console be easier, and should also assist in trading bug fixes/feature changes. 

All previous tags before the forking refactor have been deleted - they are not representative of what this library does.
